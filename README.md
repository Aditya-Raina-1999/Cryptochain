# Cryptochain
A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block c1ontains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. We have built a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.
